      <div>
      <div id="introduction">

      <div></div>Transporters is an online portal, which allows customers to list their vehicles or goods which they wish to be transported.
	Once the vehicles or goods have been listed, the transporters (who are vetted and passed) are able to bid on the deliveries. They are able to give a price outbidding others. Once the customer is happy with the price they can accept the bid and pay a deposit to secure the transport service. Once deposit is paid the details of the transporter are released to the customer to deicide a time amongst themselves. Although there are a few similar companies which exist, 
	the aim for this is to stand out by promoting exceptional customer service and have the most suitable transporters.
